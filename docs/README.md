## Getting started

Welcome to the documentation README. This page contains: 1) Getting started doc links; 2) Setup doc links; and 3) Table of Contents doc links for the complete library.

If you are new, and want to learn about our position and the scope of the project, please start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Whitepaper-WG). In addition, we encourage you to review our [glossary](glossary.md) to understand the terminology that we use throughout the website and project.

When you are ready to start building applications or to otherwise contribute to the project, we strongly recommend that you read our [protocol specification](protocol-spec.md) for the technical details. Procedurally, we use the agile methodology with a weekly sprint, organized by [issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues), so take a look to familiarize yourself with the current work.
