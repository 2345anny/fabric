## Getting started

If you are new to the Hyperledger fabric, and want to learn about our position and the scope of the project, please start with the [whitepaper](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Whitepaper-WG). In addition, we encourage you to review our [glossary](glossary.md) to understand the terminology that we use throughout the website and project.

When you are ready to start using OBC to build applications or to otherwise contribute to the project, we strongly recommend that you read our [protocol specification](protocol-spec.md) for the technical details. Procedurally, we use the agile methodology with a weekly sprint, organized by [issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues), so take a look to familiarize yourself with the current work.
